# Module-2-Challenge---Professional-Portfolio

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a professional portfolio that showcases work samples, contact information, and is responsive to different screen sizes.

As a class, our goal was to try to recreate the image below 'pixel for pixel' while incorporating our own information for future use in our job search. This portfolio will be updated throughout our course as we continue creating content.

# Wireframe
I approached this project by first creating a wireframe to organize the content accordingly.
